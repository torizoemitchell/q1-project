#Guide Bride:
This is a site for brides, grooms, bride's maids, best men, mothers and fathers of the bride or groom, and anyone else who is involved in panning a wedding.

#Fun Features:
Users are able to input the date of the wedding and see a clock ticking down to the exact moment of the event. You are able to use the navigation bar to jump to sections of the page.

#Page Contents:
The 2 sections of the site include Bridal Events & Wedding Expos, where you are able to filter upcoming events to the closest major city, and Fresh Ideas, which presents products being sold in the "weddings" category online.

#Local Storage:
The countdown you start will be stored and will resume the next time you visit the site. Your location filters for upcoming events/expos will be remembered and automatically loaded as well.
